### This is a very stupid goofy thing I wanted to make but this is mostly my opinion on things so no lets get onto the list

1. [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/) **for obvious reasons**
2. [Khoj](https://app.khoj.dev/) **This model is jam pack with stuff, But most great part about it is everytime I use it on test i get no less than a 94%. plus it has very accurate query's for searches**
3. [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) **Although it is very limited espically if you don't have a microsoft account, it works very well with doing math problems, and very good search query's too. Usually get no less than 90% with copilot**
4. [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/) **This one was very hard to chose it was this btween perplexity and copilot, but very great AI and very accurate although search query's can be sometimes goofy.**
