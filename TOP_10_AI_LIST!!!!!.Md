### This is a very stupid goofy thing I wanted to make but this is mostly my opinion on things so no lets get onto the list

1. [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/) **for obvious reasons**
2. [Khoj](https://app.khoj.dev/) **This model is jam pack with stuff, But most great part about it is everytime I use it on test i get no less than a 94%. plus it has very accurate query's for searches**
3. [Perplexity Ai Pro](https://www.perplexity.ai/) **This model has amazing search query's and gives up an 100% grade chance, but the only problem i have against it is the cost of the pro searches, but otherwise amazing.**
4. [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/) **Although it is very limited espically if you don't have a microsoft account, it works very well with doing math problems, and very good search query's too. Usually get no less than 90% with copilot**
5. [BlackBox AI](https://www.blackbox.ai/) **This one was very hard to chose it was this btween perplexity and copilot, but very great AI and very accurate although search query's can be sometimes goofy.**
6. [Perplexity Free](https://www.perplexity.ai/) **Perplexity has been an AI i've used for a while, and still use for school work. I'm pretty sure this model has been updated to be better because the responses would be very vague but know they're very straight foward and to the point. This has very accurate query's. (Grade usually over 90%)**
7. [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) **Gemini is very acccurate on what it gives you for your answer and give you alot of prompt to gives (with a 50 to 80 prompt limit I think), but even though this model is all great it still has faults with innaccurate searches and answers to questions being completely off.**
8. [ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo](https://chatgpt.com/) **Its very good  like you will mostly get a decent or execlent grade with this model, but it cannot go through the web or see files and can be very innaccurate espically with math. Otherwise if you want just a good enough grade or more this is definetly the model.**

### Thats all for now.
